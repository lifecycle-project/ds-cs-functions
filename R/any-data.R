#' Not completely missing variables
#'
#' When performing a Study Level Meta Analysis of coefficients linear models (for example), the intention should be that a consistent set of confounding variables
#' is available for each cohort and used during model fitting.
#' However it is not strictly necessary to have all confounding variables available in all cohorts in order to generate a coefficient representing the
#' relationship between exposure and outcome. Assume that some cohorts
#' have some completely empty confounding variables. In this scenario it is useful
#' to be able to specify a model to fit on all cohorts and use a look up table to understand if there are any cohorts that lack a
#' particular confounder. This look up table can be used to automatically exclude completely missing confounders without having to do this by hand. This is particularly
#' useful if you are looking at a large number of combinations of exposures, outcomes and confounders.
#'  The purpose of this function is to generate this look up table automatically.
